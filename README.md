## Background
This quiz game focuses on 16 images created by the students in Nano-materials Chemistry using an electron microscope. Each student chose an everyday object that held some meaning in their lives and took a picture of it under the microscope. They then created a clue for their image, gave the answer, and wrote a short summary describing the history of the object and what can be seen in the picture. 
I designed this website to function like a Jeopardy game. Users choose a category and dollar amount which brings up a Bootstrap Modal with the image and clue. Once the user reveals the answer, the tile on the main screen will change to show the picture to indicate that you've already answered the question. It will also bring up the answer and summary as well as show 2 radio buttons allowing the user to say if they got the answer right or wrong. This will change your earned dollar amount on the main screen, you will earn money for answering a question right and lose money for answering wrong. 
You may notice that the grid is not in a perfect square, students in the course were able to choose which category their object would fit into and there were an uneven number of questions per category. However, this website generates tiles based on the database information so changing the grid would be as easy as adding another entry to the database.
